    <h2>AT A HYPNOTIC SÉANCE.</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>A Public Hall in a provincial town. The
        Hypnotist&mdash;a tall, graceful, and handsome young man,
        in well-fitting evening clothes&mdash;has already succeeded
        in putting most of his subjects to sleep, and is going
        round and inspecting them critically, as they droop limply
        on a semicircle of chairs, in a variety of unpicturesque
        attitudes. The only Lady on the platform is evidently as
        yet in full possession of her senses.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>First Female Spectator</i> (<i>to Second</i>). MARIA
        MANGLES do take a time sending off, don't she?</p>

        <p><i>Second F.S.</i> (<i>also a friend of</i> Miss
        MANGLES). Yes, that she do&mdash;it gives her such a silly
        look, sitting there, the on'y one with her senses about
        her!</p>

        <p><i>First F.S.</i> It's all affectation&mdash;she could
        shut her eyes fast enough if she <i>liked</i>!</p>

        <p><i>Second F.S.</i> The 'Ipnotiser's coming round to her
        now&mdash;she'll <i>have</i> to go off now. (<i>With a not
        unpleasurable anticipation</i>.) I expect he'll make her do
        all manner o' ridic'lous things!</p>

        <p><i>First F.S.</i> Well, it will be a lesson, to her
        against making' herself so conspicuous another time. I
        shan't pity her.</p>

        <p><i>The Hyp.</i> (<i>after a brief colloquy with</i> Miss
        MANGLES). I see I am not likely to succeed with this Lady;
        so, with many thanks to her on behalf of myself and the
        audience for coming forward, I will detain her no
        longer.</p>

        <p>[<i>Applause, amidst which</i> Miss M. <i>descends to
        her seat in the body of the hall, with a smile of conscious
        triumph.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>First F.S.</i> (<i>disappointed</i>). I don't see
        what she's done to clap their hands about, myself!</p>

        <p><i>Second F.S.</i> Nor I neither&mdash;taking up his
        time all for nothing&mdash;depend upon it she wouldn't have
        gone up if he hadn't been so nice-looking!</p>

        <p><i>First F.S.</i> I wouldn't like to think <i>that</i>
        of her myself; but, anyhow, she didn't get much by it, did
        she? He soon sent <i>her</i> packing!</p>

        <p><i>Male Spectator</i> (<i>to a Woman in front of
        him</i>). Evening, Mrs. MIDGELLY&mdash;I see they've got
        your good man up on the platform.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. M.</i> He <i>will</i> go, Mr. BUDKIN! He's gone
        up every night the 'Ipnotiser's been here, and says he
        feels it's going to do him good. So this evening I said I'd
        come in too, and judge for myself. What good he expects to
        get, laying there like a damp dishclout, <i>I</i> don't
        know!</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Meanwhile the</i> Hypnotist <i>has borrowed a
        silver-handled umbrella from the audience, and thrust it
        before the faces of one or two loutish-looking youths, who
        immediately begin to squint horribly and follow the
        silver-top with their noses, till they knock their heads
        together.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mr. Budkin</i> (<i>to</i> Mrs. MIDGELLY). He's going
        to give your husband a turn of it now.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The umbrella-handle is applied to</i> Mr. M., <i>a
        feeble-looking little man with a sandy top-knot; he grovels
        after the silver-top when it is depressed, and makes futile
        attempts to clamber up the umbrella after it when it is
        held aloft.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>severely</i>). I haven't patience to
        look at him. A <i>Kitten</i> 'ud have had more sense!</p>

        <p><i>The Hyp.</i> (<i>calling up one of the heavy
        youths</i>). Can you whistle, Sir? Yes? Then whistle
        something. (<i>The</i> Youth <i>whistles a popular air in a
        lugubrious tone</i>.) Now you <i>can't</i>
        whistle&mdash;try. (<i>The</i> Youth <i>tries&mdash;and
        produces nothing but a close imitation of an air-cushion
        that is being unscrewed</i>.) Now, if I were not to wake
        him up, this young gentleman's friends would never enjoy
        the benefit of his whistle again!</p>

        <p><i>Voice from a Back Row. Don't</i> wake him, Guv'nor,
        we can <i>bear</i> it!</p>

        <p><i>Hyp.</i> (<i>after restoring the lost talent, and
        calling up another</i> Youth, <i>somewhat smartly
        attired</i>). Now, Sir, what do you drink?</p>

        <p><i>The Youth</i> (<i>with a sleepy candour</i>). Beer
        when I can get 'old of it.</p>

        <p><i>A Friend of his in Audience</i>. JIM's 'aving a lark
        with him&mdash;he said as 'ow he meant to kid him
        like&mdash;<i>he</i> ain't 'ipnotised, bless yer!</p>

        <p><i>Hyp.</i> But you like water, too, don't you? (JIM
        <i>admits this&mdash;in moderation.)</i> Try this. (<i>He
        gives him a tumbler of water</i>.) Is that good water?</p>

        <p><i>Jim</i> (<i>smacking his lips</i>). That's good water
        enough, Sir.</p>

        <p><i>Hyp.</i> It's bad water&mdash;taste it again.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[JIM <i>tastes, and ejects it with every symptom of
        extreme disapproval.</i></p>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Jim's Friend</i>. Try him with a drop o' Scotch in
        it&mdash;<i>'e'll</i> get it down!</p>

        <p><i>Hyp.</i> (<i>to</i> JIM). There is <i>no</i> water in
        that glass&mdash;it's full of sovereigns, don't you see?
        (JIM <i>agrees that this is so, and testifies to his
        conviction by promptly emptying the contents of the glass
        into his trousers' pocket</i>) What have you got in your
        pocket?</p>

        <p><i>Jim</i> (<i>chuckling with satisfaction</i>).
        Quids&mdash;golden sovereigns!</p>

        <p><i>Hyp.</i> Wake up! <i>Now</i> what do you find in your
        pocket&mdash;any sovereigns?</p>

        <p><i>Jim</i> (<i>surprised</i>). Sovereigns? No, Sir!
        (<i>After putting his hand in his pocket, bringing it out
        dripping, and dolefully regarding the stream of water
        issuing from his leg</i>.) More like water, Sir.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>

        of laughter.</i></p>

        <p><i>His Friend</i>. Old JIM didn't come best out o'
        that!</p>

        <p><i>Hyp.</i> (<i>to</i> JIM). You don't feel comfortable?
        (<i>Emphatic assent from</i> JIM.) Yes, you do, you feel no
        discomfort whatever.</p>

        'Ipnotism can prevent water from being wet, there must be
        <i>something</i> in it!</p>

        <p><i>Hyp.</i> I will now give you an illustration of the
        manner in which, by hypnotic influence, a subject can_ be
        affected with an entirely imaginary pain. Take this
        gentleman. (<i>Indicating the unfortunate</i> Mr. MIDGELLY,
        <i>who is slumbering peacefully</i>.) Now, what pain shall
        we give him?</p>

        tooth-ache.</p>

        <p>[<i>The Audience receive this with enthusiasm, which
        increases to rapturous delight when</i> Mr. MIDGELLY's
        <i>cheek begins to twitch violently, and he nurses his jaw
        in acute agony; the tooth-ache is then transferred to
        another victim, who writhes in an even more entertaining
        manner, until the unhappy couple are finally relieved from
        torment.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>A Spect.</i> Well, it's better nor any play, this
        is&mdash;but he ought to ha' passed the toothache round the
        lot of 'em, just for the fun o' the thing!</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Midgelly</i>. I should ha' thought there was
        toothache enough without coming here to get more of it, but
        so long as MIDGELLY's enjoyin' himself, <i>I</i> shan't
        interfere!</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The</i> Hypnot. <i>has impressed his subjects with
        the idea that there is an Angel at the other end of the
        hall, and they are variously affected by the celestial
        apparition, some gazing with a rapt grin, while others
        invoke her stiffly, or hail her like a cab.</i> Mr.
        MIDGELLY <i>alone exhibits no interest.</i></p>

    <p>Many manuals have been published for the edification of
    beginners in the art of shooting. If that art can indeed be
    acquired by reading, there is no reason why any youth, whose
    education has been properly attended to, should not be
    perfectly proficient in it without having fired a single shot.
    But, <i>Mr. Punch</i> has noticed in all these volumes a grave
    defect. In none of them is any instruction given which shall
    enable a man to obtain a conversational as well as a merely
    shooting success. Every pursuit has its proper conversational
    complement. The Farmer must know how to speak of crops and the
    weather in picturesque and inflammatory language; the Barrister
    must note, for use at the dinner-table, the subtle jests of his
    colleagues, the perplexity of stumbling witnesses, and the
    soul-stirring jokes of Judges; the Clergyman must babble of
    Sunday-schools and Choir-practices. Similarly, a Shooter must
    be able to speak of his sport and its varied incidents. To be
    merely a good shot is nothing. Many dull men can be that. The
    great thing, surely, is to be both a good shot and a cheerful
    light-hearted companion, with a fund of anecdotes and a rich
    store of allusions appropriate to every phase of shooting.
    <i>Mr. Punch</i> ventures to hope that the hints he has here
    put together, may be of value to all who propose to go out and
    "kill something" with a gun.</p>

    <h3 class="sc">The Gun.</h3>

    <p>No subject offers a greater variety of conversation than
    this. But, of course, the occasion counts for a good deal. It
    would be foolish to discharge it (metaphorically speaking) at
    the head of the first comer. You must watch for your
    opportunity. For instance, guns ought not to be talked about
    directly after breakfast, before a shot has been fired. Better
    wait till after the shooting-lunch, when a fresh start is being
    made, say for the High Covert half a mile away. You can then
    begin after this fashion to your host:&mdash;"That's a nice gun
    of yours, CHALMERS. I saw you doing rare work with it at the
    corner of the new plantation this morning." CHALMERS is sure to
    be pleased. You not only call attention to his skill, but you
    praise his gun, and a man's gun is, as a rule, as sacred to him
    as his pipe, his political prejudices, his taste in wine, or
    his wife's jewels. Therefore, CHALMERS is pleased. He smiles in
    a deprecating way, and says, "Yes, it's not a bad gun, one of a
    pair I bought last year."</p>

    <p>"Would you mind letting me feel it?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly not, my dear fellow here you are."</p>

    <p>You then interchange guns, having, of course, assured one
    another that they are not loaded. Having received CHALMERS's
    gun, you first appear to weigh it critically. Then, with an air
    of great resolution, you bring it to your shoulder two or three
    times in rapid succession, and fire imaginary shots at a cloud,
    or a tuft of grass. You now hand it back to CHALMERS,
    observing, "By Jove, old chap, it's beautifully balanced! It
    comes up splendidly. Suits me better than my own." CHALMERS,
    who will have been going through a similar pantomime with your
    gun, will make some decently complimentary remark about it, and
    each of you will think the other a devilish knowing and
    agreeable fellow.</p>

    <p>From this point you can diverge into a discussion of the
    latest improvements, as, <i>e.g.</i>, "Are ejectors really
    valuable?" This is sure to bring out the man who has tried
    ejectors, and has given them up, because last year, at one of
    the hottest corners he ever knew, when the sky was simply black
    with pheasants, the ejectors of both his guns got stuck. He
    will talk of this incident as another man might talk of the
    loss of a friend or a fortune. Here you may say,&mdash;"By gad,
    what frightful luck! What did you do?" He will then narrate his
    comminatory interview with his gun-maker; others will burst in,
    and defend ejectors, or praise their own gun-makers, and the
    ball, once set rolling, will not be stopped until you take your
    places for the first beat of the afternoon, just as MARKHAM is
    telling you that his old Governor never shoots with anything
    but an old muzzle-loader by MANTON, and makes deuced good
    practice with it too.</p>

    <p>"Choke" is not a very good topic; it doesn't last long.
    After you have asked your neighbour if his gun is choked, and
    told him that your left barrel has a modified choke, the
    subject is pretty well exhausted.</p>

    <p>"Cast-off." Not to be recommended. There is very little to
    be made of it.</p>

    <p>Something may be done with the price of guns. There's sure
    to be someone who has done all his best and straightest
    shooting with a gun that cost him only £15. Everybody else will
    say, "It's perfect rot giving such high prices for guns. You
    only pay for the name. Mere robbery." But there isn't one of
    them who would consent not to be robbed.</p>

    <p>It sometimes creates a pretty effect to call your gun "My
    old fire-iron," or "my bundook," or "this old gas-pipe of
    mine."</p>

    <p>"Bore." Never pun on this word. It is never done in really
    good sporting society. But you can make a few remarks, here and
    there, about the comparative merits of twelve-bore and
    sixteen-bore. Choose a good opening for telling your story of
    the man who shot with a fourteen-bore gun, ran short of
    cartridges on a big day, and was, of course, unable to borrow
    from anyone else. Hence you can deduce the superiority of
    twelve-bores, as being the more common size.</p>

    <p>All these subjects, like all others connected with shooting,
    can be resumed and continued after dinner, and in the
    smoking-room. Talk of the staleness of smoke! It's nothing to
    the staleness of the stories to which four self-respecting
    smoking-room walls have to listen in the course of an
    evening.</p>

    <p>The good common sense of the Common Councilman and Liverymen
    of the City,&mdash;Liverymen not to be led astray by any false
    lights,&mdash;coupled with their truly English love of
    fairplay, prevailed, and the City Fathers on Goose Day were
    prevented from following in the goose-steps of that Uncommon
    Councilman who, bearing the honoured names of BEAUFOY (a fine

    made so extraordinary a display of bigotry and ignorance as, it

    </div>

    <p>At this moment there is really a very excellent
    extertainment at the Empire Theatre of Varieties, something, or
    rather many things of which the Management may, and should be
    proud. A capital troupe of Bicyclists, a Spanish Dancer and
    singer&mdash;whose gestures to the multitude are more
    intelligible than her language&mdash;a graceful, serpentine
    dancer, and "a very peculiar American Comedian"&mdash;all these
    are a part of the programme. But the best item in this liberal
    bill of fare is <i>Round the Town</i>, a characteristic Ballet,
    in five <i>tableaux</i>. The composers of this pleasing piece
    are Madame KATTI LANNER, and Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES. As the lady
    is well known for her admirable dances, it may be safely
    presumed that the gentleman is solely responsible for the plot,
    or rather "the argument." It runs as follows:&mdash;"<i>Dr.
    Burch</i>, newly arrived in London with his pupils, wishes to
    show them the sights. What better to begin with than Covent
    Garden Market in the early morning?" Quite so, the more
    especially as the lads must be very backward boys. There are
    six of them, and the youngest seems about thirty, and the
    oldest about double that age. The Doctor must have rescued them
    from Epsom Race Course, and apparently is attempting to give
    them an education fitting them to follow what seems to be his
    own calling&mdash;the profession of an undertaker. These
    elderly pupils follow their kind preceptor (for, although he is
    called <i>Burch</i>, there is not the slightest suggestion of
    the rod about him, and, moreover, his charges are really too
    elderly to receive chastisement) to the Royal Exchange, the
    Thames Embankment, and, lastly, to the Empire. During their
    travels, they meet <i>Mr. Rapless</i>, known as "the Oofless
    Swell," (a part amusingly played by Mr. W. WARDE), and <i>John
    Brough</i>, a carpenter with a taste for ballet costumes and
    drink, the carpenter's wife, and the carpenter's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"
       id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span> child. <i>Dr. Burch</i>,
       who is evidently easy-going, but good-hearted, after
       flirting with a lady who has her boots cleaned before the
       Royal Exchange, suddenly developes into a philanthropist,
       not to say a divine. On the carpenter's wife and child
       appearing on the Thames Embankment in the characters of
       would-be suicides, the worthy pedagogue convinces them (to
       quote the programme) "That they have no right to take away
       the lives which the Almighty has placed in their hands."
       Mother and child are quickly convinced, and the neat but
       drunken father (Signorina MALVINA CAVALAZZI) appearing on
       the scene, the good man informs him that his wife and child
       are dead, "driven to an untimely grave by his (the
       intemperate but natty artisan's) desertion and cruelty." The
       effect of this inaccurate statement is startling. To quote
       once more from the argument, "incontinently the now penitent
       ruffian falls fainting to the ground." But he is brought
       back to himself, his better self, by his child whispering
       "Father!" The situation is full of pathos, even when
       witnessed from the Stalls. Recovering his senses, the
       converted carpenter promptly borrows money from the good old
       Doctor, and when that estimable gentleman is about to enter
       the Empire Theatre of Varieties (accompanied by his school),
       a little later he has the "satisfaction of seeing his
       <i>protégé Mortimer</i> (the ex-ruffian), returning
       contentedly from his work." This is the simple but pathetic
       story that Mr. GEO. EDWARDES touchingly tells with the
       assistance of a full <i>corps de ballet</i>, five
       <i>tableaux</i>, and last, but certainly not least, the
       hints of Madame KATTI LANNER.</p>

    <p>There are many remarkable persons in <i>Round the Town</i>.
    Notably an effeminate but substantial stock-broker, who looks
    like a stock-jobber's maiden-aunt in disguise. Another
    important personage is a representative of the Navy, whose
    figure suggests as an appropriate greeting, "Hip, hip, hip,
    hooray!" Both these characters are well-played, and although
    subordinate parts, make their mark, or rather, we should say,
    score heavily. Altogether; the ballet is excellent both in
    dances and plot. The first is a testimony of the good head of
    Madame KATTI LANNER, and the last of the equally good heart of
    Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES. There is no doubt that <i>Round the
    Town</i> will draw all London to see (in its realistic scenes)
    all London drawn!</p>

    <h2>WRITTEN A HUNDRED YEARS HENCE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>From a Collection of Communications supplied by our
    Prophetic Compiler.</i>)</h4>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Forgive me for addressing you, but the
    urgency of the occasion warrants the intrusion. A hundred years
    since, the old Fighting <i>Foudroyant</i> was sold by the
    Admiralty to be broken up. The moment the Public of the Period
    learned the cruel fact through the customary sources of
    information, they flew to the rescue. Headed by the then LORD
    MAYOR, they raised a fund to bring back the discarded vessel,
    and yet in those distant days there were they who denied that
    the <i>Foudroyant</i> had ever done anything in particular. And
    now we propose doing the same thing. On the Thames there is an
    ancient steamboat called <i>Citizen Z</i>, that once belonged
    to the Company that started penny river lifts. It is certainly
    rather out of date, but is full of historical memories. It is
    said that the Cabinet travelled to Greenwich on its venerable
    boards, where they feasted on the half-forgotten Whitebait, and
    the entirely, superseded Champagne. It has carried, at one time
    or another, all the nobility to Rosherville, there to spend (as
    the old saying went) "a happy day," and yet it is proposed to
    break it up! Out upon the thought! Have we no veneration for
    our relics of the past? Cannot we appreciate a boat that should
    have had an honoured place in the Museum at Woolwich? Do not
    let this act of Vandalism be done. Save the steamer for the
    sake of its past.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours truly, A REAR-ADMIRAL.</p>

    <p><i>H.M.S. Electric-Balloon, Skye.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;I appeal to you, and I know I shall
    not appeal in vain. The picturesque Cabman's Shelter in the
    middle of Piccadilly is threatened! I hope you will exert your
    influence to preserve it. It absolutely teems with historical
    associations. Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL is supposed to have used
    it for writing his famous letter on the Poor-Laws, and to this
    day is shown the initials of CHARLES STUART PARNELL which were
    carved by that celebrated statesman on one of its benches about
    the middle of the last century&mdash;probably in 1854. And why
    is it to be removed? Simply because it is said to impede the
    traffic! Could anything be more absurd? Do, pray, save it from
    the hand of the ruthless "improver." Yours truly,</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>Mount Street, Grosvenor Square.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>We were not overcrowded last week at Newmarket, and really
    the more one takes racing from a business point of view, the
    more attractive it becomes!&mdash;at least, I have found it so
    myself ever since it has been my duty to acquire information
    for the benefit of my readers.</p>

    <p>There was only one thing that annoyed me during the week,
    and that was the inconsiderate behaviour of <i>Windgall</i> in
    winning the October Handicap, although it was a most
    extraordinary confirmation of my remarks anent his performance
    in the Leicester Handicap, in my last letter; but it <i>is</i>
    annoying that, when you select a horse to win a race, he runs
    <i>second</i>, and directly after wins a race for which he is
    <i>not</i> selected, beating the horse chosen by a
    length!&mdash;it puzzles me completely, as it is impossible in
    this case to put it down to want of good breeding! We were
    sorry not to have the <i>Buccaneer-Orvieto</i> match decided,
    as it would have been the event of the meeting; but, as the old
    proverb runs, "a wise owner is merciful to his beast," so
    <i>Orvieto</i> had an afternoon's rest at the price of
    £100!&mdash;rather more than some people might be inclined to
    pay for a game of forfeits!</p>

    <p>The time is not yet ripe&mdash;(has anyone <i>ever</i> seen
    time get ripe, I wonder?)&mdash;for disclosing what I know
    about the Cesarewitch&mdash;(I never know whether I've spelt
    that correctly or not!&mdash;and the more you look at it the
    "wronger" it seems!)&mdash;but I may mention that I've heard
    great accounts of <i>Kingkneel</i>, who was bought the other
    day for Sir GREENASH BURNLEY (the latest favourite of fortune,
    and beloved of the ring)&mdash;and had he not earned a
    penalty&mdash;(this expression ought to be changed, as it
    implies, to my mind, which is an <i>excellent</i> average
    sample; a misdemeanor)&mdash;by winning a paltry thousand
    pounds race somewhere; I really believe the
    Cesare&mdash;no!&mdash;not again!&mdash;was at his
    mercy&mdash;but now, as the turf-writer puts it&mdash;"I shall
    look elsewhere!"&mdash;as if <i>that</i> would make any
    difference!&mdash;but of this race, more anon, and meantime,
    those who are fond of the "good things" of this life must not
    miss my selection for the big race of next week at
    Kempton&mdash;on the Jubilee Course, which said course, I am
    told, is by no means a Jubilee for the jockeys, owing to the
    danger in "racing for the bend."</p>

    <p>There are several horses entered who seem to have great
    chances, making the race as difficult as a problem in
    <i>Euclid</i>&mdash;but my selection will most certainly be
    "there, or thereabouts," which is a comforting, if somewhat
    vague reflection.</p>

    <h4 class="sc">(In the Pound).</h4>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I have been much struck with the suggestion to do
    without hats, and have made trial of the system. It has also
    made trial of <i>me</i>, in the way of colds in the head,
    bronchial catarrh, &amp;c., but I still persevere. <i>It's so
    much cheaper!</i> I have sold my stock of old hats for
    half-a-crown, and calculate that I shall save <i>quite three
    shillings per annum</i> by not buying new ones. Surely anybody
    can see that this is well worth doing! I am now seriously
    contemplating the possibility of <i>doing without
    boots</i>!</p>

    <p class="author">Yours truly,<br />
    SAVE THE SAXPENCES.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;Talk about hair growing if you leave off hats! My
    hair was falling off in handfuls a little time ago. Did I
    abjure hats altogether? Not being a born idiot, I did not. But
    I saw that what was needed was proper ventilation aloft. So I
    had a specially-constructed top-hat made, with holes all round
    it. In fact there were more holes than hat, and the hatter
    scornfully referred to it as a "sieve." The invention answered
    splendidly. There was a thorough draught constantly rushing
    across the top of my head, with the speed and violence of a
    first-class tornado. My locks, before so scanty, at once began
    to grow in such profusion that it now seems impossible to stop
    them, except by liberal applications of "Crinificatrix," the
    Patent Hair Restorer. <i>That</i> checks the growth
    effectually. My general name among chance acquaintances is "Old
    Doormat." You can judge how thick my hair must be and I ascribe
    it entirely to the beneficent action of the draught, as
    before,</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, WELL-COVERED.</p>

    <p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;Why would it be a mistake to say that a
    Negro was "as black as my hat?" <i>Because I never wear
    one.</i> The only inconvenience resulting is in wet
    weather&mdash;but, even then, I am prepared for all
    emergencies. I keep in my pocket a little square of black
    waterproof, to cover my head when it rains. In an Assize town,
    the other day, I was followed by an angry crowd, who imagined
    that I was one of the Judges, and that I had gone mad, and was
    walking about the streets with the black cap on! But all true
    reformers are treated in this way, even in England, the land of
    Liberty.</p>

    <h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. XVI.&mdash;TO YOUTHFULNESS.</h3>

    <p>You are much misunderstood. For it is supposed that those
    who in this world bear your stamp upon them are to be
    recognised without trouble by the mere calculation of their
    years of life. No notion can be further from the truth. Mere
    absence of wrinkles, the presence or colour of the hair on the
    head, the elasticity of limbs, these do not of themselves, I
    protest, testify to youthfulness. I knew a lad of twenty, who,
    in the judgment of the world, was young. In mine he was one of
    the hoariest as he was one of the least scrupulous of men. No
    veteran that I ever met could have put him up to any trick, or
    added any experience to his store. He seemed to have a
    marvellous and intuitive experience of the ways of life, and of
    the tricks of men. No shady society came amiss to him. He
    gambled, in his way, as coolly, and with as careful a
    precision, as <i>Barry Lyndon</i>; he met the keen frequenters
    of the betting-ring on equal terms, and contrived, amid that
    vortex to keep his head above water. He had a faultless taste
    in wine&mdash;he knew a good cigar by an instinct. It is hardly
    necessary to add that, with all these accomplishments, he held
    and expressed the meanest opinion of human nature in general.
    Not even Sir ROBERT WALPOLE could have more cynically estimated
    the price at which men might be bought. As for women, this
    precocious paragon despised them, and women, as is their wont,
    repaid him by admiration, and, here and there, by genuine
    affection. I shudder to think how he might have developed in
    the course of years. It happened, however, that a
    shipwreck&mdash;a form of disaster against which cynicism and
    precocity afford no protection&mdash;removed him from the world
    before he had come of age. Now, to call this infant young,
    would have been a mockery. To all outward appearance, indeed,
    he was a boy, but his mind was that of a selfish and used-up
    <i>roué</i> of sixty, without illusions, and without hope.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Let me pass to a more pleasant subject, and one with which
    you, my dear boy, are more closely connected. I refer to my old
    friend. General VANGARD, the kindest and best-natured man that
    ever drew half-pay. Seventy years have passed over his head,
    and turned his hair to silver, but his heart remains pure gold
    without alloy. In vain do his whiskers and moustache attempt to
    give a touch of fierceness to his face. The kindly eyes smile
    it away in a moment. He stands six feet and an inch, his back
    his broad, his step springy; he carries his head erect on his
    massive shoulders with a leonine air of good-humoured defiance.
    To hear him greet you, to feel his hand-shake, is to get a
    lesson in geniality. I never knew a man who had so
    whole-hearted a contempt for insincerity and affectation. It
    was only the other day that I saw little TOM TITTERTON, of the
    Diplomatic Service, introduced to him. TOM is a devil of a
    fellow in Society. He warbles little songs of his own
    composition at afternoon teas, he insinuates himself into the
    elderly affections of stony-hearted dowagers, he can lead a
    <i>cotillon</i> to perfection, and is universally acknowledged
    as an authority on gloves and handkerchiefs. It was at a
    shooting-party that he and the General met. The little fellow
    advanced simpering, and raised a limp and dangling hand to
    about the height of his eyes. The General had extended his in
    his usual bluff and unceremonious manner. Naturally enough the
    hands failed to meet. A puzzled look came over the General's
    face. In a moment, however, he had grasped the situation, and
    TITTERTON's hand, and shaken the latter with a ferocious
    heartiness. "OW!" screamed TOM. It was a short exclamation, but
    a world of agony was concentrated into it. "The old bear has
    spoilt my shooting for the day," said TITTERTON to me
    afterwards, as he missed his tenth partridge. That very
    evening, I remember, there was a great discussion in the
    smoking-room on the subject of wrestling. One of the party, a
    burly youth of twenty-six, boasted somewhat loudly of the
    tricks that a Cornishman had lately taught him. For a long time
    the General sat silently puffing his cigar, but at length the
    would-be wrestler said something that roused him. "Would you
    mind showing me how that's done?" he said; "I seem to remember
    something about it, but it was done differently in my time. No
    doubt your notion's an improvement." Nothing loth the burly one
    stood up. I don't quite know what happened. The General seemed
    to stoop with outstretched hands and then raise himself with a
    spring as he met his opponent. A large body hurtled through the
    air, and in a moment the younger man was lying flat on the
    carpet amidst the shouts of the company. "It's the old 'flying
    mare' my boy," said the General to me, "a very useful dodge. I
    learnt it fifty years ago."</p>

    <p>In the company of young men the General is at his very best.
    He knows all their little weaknesses, and chaffs them with
    delightful point and humour, though he would not, for all the
    world, give them pain. It is a pleasant sight to see the old
    fellow with a party of his young friends, poking sly fun at
    them, laughing with them, taking all their jests in good part,
    and thoroughly enjoying himself. He can walk most of them off
    their legs still, can row with them on the broad reaches of the
    Thames, and keep his form with the best of them; he can hold
    his gun straight at driven birds, and revel like a boy in a
    rattling run to hounds across country. All the youngsters
    respect him by instinct, and love the cheery old fellow, whose
    heart is as soft as his muscles are hard. They talk to him as
    to an elder brother, come to him for his advice, and, which is
    perhaps even more strange, like it, and follow it. Withal, the
    General is the most modest of men. In his youth he was a mighty
    man of war. It was only the other day that I heard (not from
    his own lips, you may be sure) the thrilling stories of his
    hand-to-hand conflict with two gigantic Russians in the fog of
    Inkermann, and of his rescue of a wounded Sergeant at the
    attack in the Redan. With women, old or young, the General uses
    an old-fashioned and chivalrous courtesy, as far removed from
    latter-day smartness as was BAYARD from BOULANGER. The younger
    ones adore him. They all seem to be his nieces, for they all
    call him Uncle JOHN.</p>

    <p>A year or two ago the General fell ill, and the doctors
    shook their heads. It was touching to see the concern of all
    his young friends. CHARLIE CHIRPER, a gay little butterfly of a
    fellow, who never seemed to treat life as anything but a huge
    joke, became gloomy with anxiety. Twice every day he called to
    make inquiries, and, as the bulletins got worse, CHARLIE became
    visibly thinner. I saw him at the Club one evening, sitting
    moodily in a corner. "What's up, CHARLIE?" I said to him. "You
    look as if you'd been refused by an heiress." "The Old
    General's worse to-day," said CHARLIE, simply. "They're very
    anxious about him. No, dash it all!" he went on, "it's too bad.
    I can't bear to think of it. Such an old ripper as the General!
    Why must they take him? Why can't they take a useless chap like
    me, who never did anyone any good?" And the unaccustomed tears
    came into the lad's eyes as he turned his head away. But the
    old General battled through, and, thank Heaven, I can still
    write of him in the present tense.</p>

    <p>A traveller in Italy during the middle ages knew a Chemist
    very well indeed. One day a rather stylish Lady, with a shifty
    look about the eyes, entered the shop and asked for some
    poison. "I cannot furnish you. Madam, with what you require. I
    have quarrelled with the undertaker." The Traveller
    subsequently ascertained that the name of the lady was LUCREZIA

    foot a BLUCHER, and on the other a WELLINGTON. It is fortunate
    for me I cannot find pairs of both! This is a proof (if one is

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
